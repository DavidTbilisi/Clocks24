At midnight in Philadelphia,
the City Hall Clock bleeds green light.
It beats like a heart on wires,
calling the wanderer out of shadows.

He walks not for glory,
not for gold.
He walks for a soul —
his love —
shattered, scattered through clocks across the world.

---

*01:00 — Paris, Orsay Clock*
The glass face opens like a wound.
Trains of light hiss through the night.
He boards one alone.
Her laugh echoes down the rails,
then fades.

*02:00 — Dorchester, Edwardian Tower*
Metal birds explode into the dark.
Their wings drop burning notes,
letters she once wrote.
He catches one: Seek me where stars fall.

*03:00 — New York, Grand Central*
The clock drips silver seconds.
He cups them in his hands,
drinks one down.
Her voice touches his throat,
soft as a scar.

*04:00 — Vienna, Anker Clock*
Figures march, their eyes red and cold.
One turns.
It winks.
He shudders.
A sign, or a trick?

---

*05:00 — Ottawa, Peace Tower*
The bell doesn’t sing —
it cracks the air like a blade.
Through the pain he feels her touch,
a phantom on his shoulder:
Don’t stop.

*06:00 — London, Selfridges*
On neon streets, two duelers fight.
Their blades clash,
but in the sparks he sees
the shape of her face.

*07:00 — Edinburgh, Binns Clock*
Jazz notes drip like rain.
Every sound is a memory
he cannot hold.
He dances with shadows,
pretending they are her.

*08:00 — Milwaukee, Allen-Bradley Tower*
Four faces watch the sky.
Satellites whisper in static.
Through the noise he hears it:
her heart beating far away.

---

*09:00 — Berlin, World Clock*
Cities spin like dice.
He steps, and the world shifts.
He lands in Prague,
beneath a sky full of fire.

*10:00 — Tbilisi, Leaning Tower*
The tower bends like broken code.
Children laugh,
but their shadows stretch into dragons.
One exhales smoke.
Her name burns in the haze.

*11:00 — Mecca, Royal Clock Tower*
The desert clock pierces the sky.
Pilgrims kneel.
He kneels too.
He whispers: Wait for me.

*12:00 — Wells, Cathedral Clock*
Old knights circle endlessly.
One stops.
Rust flakes away from its jaw.
It points.
Venice.

---

*13:00 — Bern, Zytglogge*
The bell hums like a lullaby.
He dreams lives not lived:
her hand in his,
their lips pressed,
their children laughing.
He wakes empty.

*14:00 — Prague, Astronomical Clock*
Stars shatter.
Zodiac wheels spin like knives.
Constellations fall.
He walks through firelight
to find her face in the sky.

*15:00 — Venice, St. Mark’s Clock*
Two lions guard the square.
They bare their teeth,
but then bow low.
Between them she calls his name.
He runs,
but she vanishes.

---

*16:00 — Ulm, Town Hall Clock*
Letters fall like ash.
He gathers them,
reads words only he and she would know.
Her ghost is close.

*17:00 — Sighișoara, Clock Tower*
Beats pound from the tower’s roof.
The DJ scratches vinyl made of bone.
Each sound is a century.
He feels her heat in the crowd,
but sees only strangers.

*18:00 — Lyon, Astronomical Clock*
Puppets jerk on iron wires.
One sings in her voice.
He runs to it,
but the song is hollow,
empty.

---

*19:00 — Moscow, Spasskaya Tower*
The red clock grins.
Its tick is a soldier’s march.
Its tock is a war drum.
Yet in the rhythm,
her heartbeat hides.

*20:00 — New York, Atlas Clock*
Atlas strains,
but he holds not earth —
he holds her soul in pieces.
The walker begs: Give her back.
Atlas says nothing.

*21:00 — London, Big Ben*
Big Ben roars.
Clouds grind into gears.
Rain falls like broken glass.
Still, light breaks through.
He feels her hand again.

---

*22:00 — Nantes, Sainte-Croix*
The toll is static, harsh.
But in the crackle hides a whisper:
Come. One hour more.

*23:00 — Istanbul, Dolmabahçe*
The tower flickers old to new.
A woman climbs with whip of light.
She strikes,
and the fog clears.
At the top — her shadow.

---

*Finale — Midnight*
Back in Philadelphia.
The City Hall Clock tolls once more.
But he is not alone.
From every bell, every gear,
her fragments return.

She steps from the dark.
Her eyes burn with stars.
Their hands meet.
Time stops.
The clocks fall silent.
